The Process
===========

Inspired by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/viktorklang/status/481109888656244736) by the [Legend of Klang](https://github.com/viktorklang), this is not a framework (sorry Victor) but an experiment on event-driven architectures using modern tools. Yes, it includes Kafka. Thus, the title ;)

Why? I feel that lately there's a lot of buzz about concepts like DDD, Event-Driven, Reactive, Akka and others. The problem is that, often, it's hard to figure out the way to mix all these theoretical concepts together into practical software used by a company. Sometimes a practical model you can see in action is better to discuss and learn concepts. This intends to be this model.

The aim is to build a sample application, with basic functionality, that illustrates interaction between different components interact, helps to understand several concepts related to software architecture, and facilitates discussion to refine and improve the architecture.

Some disclaimers:

* this doesn't contain revolutionary concepts. All this has been talked about quite a lot (thanks Internet!), it's more an intent to bring things together for clarity.
* it is completely possible that some concepts have been misunderstood or applied incorrectly. 
* previous point notwithstanding, the model doesn't aim to pure application of theoretical concepts but to build a working model suitable for software development in the modern web world.
* the main aim of this project is to generate a discussion and to receive feedback. Only through collaboration it will be possible to polish the model and understand limitations and oversights in its design.
